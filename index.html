                    <h3>Accidental Poisoning at Local Coffee Shop Sends Three to Hospital</h3>
                    <p>In a shocking incident yesterday afternoon, three patrons of a downtown coffee shop were hospitalized after an accidental poisoning. The incident occurred when a cleaning solution was mistakenly used in place of a milk substitute. Emergency responders arrived quickly, and all affected customers were treated at the scene before being transported to the hospital. Authorities have launched an investigation into how the mix-up occurred, while the coffee shop remains temporarily closed. Fortunately, the individuals are expected to make a full recovery.</p>

                    <h3>Death Toll From hurricane Helene Rises</h3>
                    <p>The death toll from Hurricane Helene inched up to 227 on Saturday as the grim task of recovering bodies continued more than a week after the monster storm ravaged the Southeast and killed people in six states.
                        Helene came ashore Sept. 26 as a Category 4 hurricane and carved a wide swath of destruction as it moved northward from Florida, washing away homes, destroying roads and knocking out electricity and cellphone service for millions.
                        The number of deaths stood at 225 on Friday; two more were recorded in South Carolina the following day. It was still unclear how many people were unaccounted for or missing, and the toll could rise even higher.
                        Helene is the deadliest hurricane to hit the mainland U.S. since Katrina in 2005. About half the victims were in North Carolina, while dozens more were killed in Georgia and South Carolina.
